# How Ready Are Generative Pre-trained Large Language Models for Explaining Bengali Grammatical Errors?
This repository contains code and data for the paper titled "How Ready Are Generative Pre-trained Large Language Models for Explaining Bengali Grammatical Errors?" The goal of this research is to evaluate the performance of various pre-trained large language models on the task of correcting grammatical errors in Bengali sentences and providing concise explanations for each error type. It is important to note that the codes include only one-shot example.

### Code Files:

The following Python scripts are included in the repository:

- gpt-4-turbo.py
- gpt-3.5-turbo.py
- text-davinci-003.py
- text-curie-001.py
- text-babbage-001.py
- text-ada-001.py
- llama-2-7b.py
- llama-2-13b.py
- llama-2-70b.py
  
Each script is designed to take a Bengali sentence with errors as input and output the corrected sentence along with concise explanations for each error type. The models used include GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, text-davinci-003, text-curie-001, text-babbage-001, text-ada-001, llama-2-7b, llama-2-13b, and llama-2-70b.

### Dataset Samples:

The dataset is provided in the "Dataset Samples" directory, which contains 100 .txt files. Each file includes an erroneous Bengali sentence and its corresponding human-annotated correct Bengali sentence.
